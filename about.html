        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Emir McGreevy, a Statistics major and UX minor at the University of Michigan with a passion for sports analytics, data visualization, and user-centered design. I specialize in turning raw data into stories that inform strategy—whether that’s helping a team optimize performance or making complex stats more accessible to fans. Outside of academics, I’m curious, detail-oriented, and love exploring new ways to turn data into meaningful insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Michigan, I’ve built a strong foundation in R, Python, and SQL through my Statistics major, while my UX minor has sharpened my skills in user research, visual communication, and accessible design. I’ve brought this mix of technical and creative thinking to projects across multiple sports. From analyzing MLB defensive trends and NFL salary efficiency to working with live Catapult sensor data for Michigan Volleyball. I’ve also conducted athlete interviews to better understand how they interact with training spaces, combining qualitative insights with a data-driven mindset. Outside of sports, I explored data equity through a research project on the digital divide between Detroit and suburban high schools, using survey design and analysis to uncover disparities in technology access and digital resources. Based on the findings, I brainstormed and proposed potential solutions aimed at improving digital infrastructure and support for underserved schools. Whether I’m coding, designing, or presenting, my goal is always to make complex information clear, engaging, and actionable.
        </p>

        <h1>Campus Involvement</h1>

        <p>
          Outside of academics, I am a part of the Michigan Sports Analytics Society, work with Catapult sensor data for
          the volleyball team, and am a member of Alpha Delta Pi Sorority.
        </p>

        <p>
          Michigan Sports Analytics Society (MSAS) is a student-led organization that brings together students passionate about sports and data. We meet weekly to discuss, debate, and analyze current topics in sports, including game strategies, injuries, recruiting, and forecasted game spreads. The club also offers workshops and tutorials in coding languages like Python and R. Last fall, I participated in the Python tutorial, where I learned to code in Python and apply those skills to data visualization and sports analytics. At the end of each academic year, MSAS hosts a symposium where members present the independent research projects they’ve worked on throughout the semester. At the 2025 symposium, my project about the MLB shift ban was awarded runner-up for Outstanding Project.
        </p>

        <p>
          My work with the Human Performance & Sport Science Center and the University of Michigan Women’s Volleyball team involves analyzing performance data using Catapult athlete tracking technology. I help collect and interpret sensor data from practices and games to monitor workload, identify trends, and support training decisions. The position is both exciting and hands-on, allowing me to apply data analysis in a real-world sports setting while working alongside coaches, athletic trainers, and athletes. It’s also a great opportunity to be involved with one of the largest collegiate athletic programs in the country.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a member of Alpha Delta Pi at the University of Michigan, where I previously served as Formal Events Chair. In this role, I planned and coordinated four date parties over the course of two semesters. This involved everything from budgeting, venue selection, and transportation logistics to designing promotional materials and managing guest lists. The position helped me build skills in event planning, organization, and communication while also contributing to a fun and memorable experience for our chapter. Beyond my position, being part of ADPi has given me the opportunity to build lifelong friendships, participate in philanthropy events, and be part of a strong campus community. It’s also helped me grow as a leader, teammate, and communicator both socially and professionally.
        </p>

        <h1>Beyond the Numbers</h1>

        <p>
          When I’m not diving into data or designing user experiences, you’ll probably find me at various Michigan sporting events. Sports have been a central part of my life from the very beginning. Every summer of my childhood was spent at the ballfield, watching my older siblings’ baseball and softball games. I also was a cheerleader for 15 years and played softball for 11, experiences that shaped who I am today. These early experiences sparked a lifelong passion for athletics that not only fuels my personal interests but also drives my academic focus in sports analytics. I’m fascinated by how data can tell the story behind the game and help athletes and teams perform at their best. Beyond sports, these lessons have helped me stay motivated and adaptable in all areas of my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of sports, I love spending time in Northern Michigan. Whether it’s spending the day on the lake, hiking, or just hanging out at the cabin playing cards with friends and family, it's my favorite way to recharge and disconnect. I enjoy exploring all of the local towns and stopping in cool bookstores to pick up new books to read. Visiting every year is one of my favorite family traditions since it's the perfect way to slow down and be present with the people I care about. 
        </p>

        <h1>Looking Ahead</h1>

        <p>
          I'm excited to pursue opportunities that combine my interests in data, sports, and user experience whether that’s in sports analytics, UX research, or product strategy. I’m especially drawn to roles that allow me to explore how thoughtful design and data can create more equitable, informed, and enjoyable experiences.
