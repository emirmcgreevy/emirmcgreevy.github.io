    <h1 class="ux-title">Understanding Female Athletes’ Experiences with University of Michigan Athletic Facilities</h1>

    <p class="ux-intro">
      This project, conducted as part of a Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation class,
      investigated how female Division I athletes at the University of Michigan experience their
      workout and practice facilities. While the university is known for its strong athletic tradition,
      disparities in resources and access between teams can impact training quality, recovery, and overall well-being.
    </p>

    <h2 class="ux-section-title">My Role</h2>
    <ul class="ux-list">
      <li><strong>UX Researcher</strong> — Led participant recruitment, interview design, data collection, and analysis.</li>
      <li>Developed a research plan, conducted 5 in-depth interviews, and synthesized findings into actionable insights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ux-section-title">Research Goals</h2>
    <ol class="ux-list">
      <li><strong>Understand</strong> the daily patterns and facility usage habits of female athletes.</li>
      <li><strong>Identify</strong> pain points, barriers, and gaps in resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Explore</strong> opportunities for improving training spaces, equipment access, and athlete support systems.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="ux-section-title">Methods</h2>
    <ul class="ux-list">
      <li><strong>Recruitment & Screener:</strong> Targeted outreach to female D1 athletes, screener survey for relevance.</li>
      <li><strong>In-Depth Interviews:</strong> Five one-hour sessions focused on facility use, challenges, and improvements.</li>
      <li><strong>Affinity Diagramming:</strong> Grouped over 100 participant statements into thematic clusters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ux-section-title">Key Findings</h2>
    <ul class="ux-list">
      <li><strong>Facility Limitations:</strong> Outdated equipment, lack of AC, insufficient sport-specific features.</li>
      <li><strong>Resource Gaps:</strong> No athlete cafeteria, limited recovery facilities for some teams.</li>
      <li><strong>Scheduling & Accessibility:</strong> Inconvenient facility locations, late practice times due to conflicts.</li>
      <li><strong>Positive Aspects:</strong> Access to trainers and mental performance coaches, strong team community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ux-section-title">Example Quotes</h2>
    <blockquote class="ux-quote">
      “Our school is one of the highest performing athletic programs. They don't really treat the facilities in like the updated way. Like, they're constantly updating football and basketball, but the majority of other sports don't get that.”
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="ux-quote">
      “The only thing [the athletes] at the school talk about,  is that we don't have an athlete cafeteria which is like huge at every other  power five school and that would make our lives so much easier”
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="ux-quote">
      ““Also, like we don't have TeraFlex floor, which almost every team has. It makes it so when you jump, it hurts less... the wooden courts really beat up your body.””
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="ux-section-title">Opportunities for Improvement</h2>
    <ul class="ux-list">
      <li>Modernize non-revenue sport facilities with better ventilation, flooring, and recovery equipment.</li>
      <li>Create a central athlete fueling station accessible to all teams.</li>
      <li>Improve scheduling coordination to reduce conflicts and late practice times.</li>
      <li>Provide secure, sport-specific storage/locker space for all teams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ux-section-title">Impact & Reflection</h2>
    <p class="ux-paragraph">
      This project deepened my experience in <strong>qualitative UX research</strong>, from participant recruitment through
      thematic synthesis. I learned how to balance <strong>empathy with actionable recommendations</strong>, translating
      athletes’ frustrations into realistic proposals that could improve performance, health, and morale.
